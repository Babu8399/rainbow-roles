# Discord Rainbow Roles Bot
Make your Discord server roles (usernames) change color in real time!

Developed as a Discord bot programming exercise, this Discord bot allows server admins to create special roles that let users have **color changing names**!
Simple add a new role named `"rainbow-(colors or color sets)"` and the bot will automatically start cycling colors for that role.
Note that this bot will also spam your server's audit log with "updated role" as it has to update all rainbow roles every few seconds.

Click [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591131468688916497&permissions=268487680&scope=bot) to invite this bot to your server.
